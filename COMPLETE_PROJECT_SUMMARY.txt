10. FEEDBACK SYSTEM:
    - User feedback collection
    - Name, email, message fields

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
======================
- MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)
- 15+ routes, 18 HTML templates
- RESTful API design
- Responsive UI with mobile support
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- Protected routes with authentication guards

SECURITY FEATURES:
=================
- Password hashing with PBKDF2-SHA256 (260,000+ iterations)
- Secure session management with encrypted cookies
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Authentication guards on protected routes
- Reset token expiration (15 minutes)

DATABASE SCHEMA:
===============
User Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- email (Unique, Not Null)
- password_hash (Hashed with Werkzeug)

Consultation Table:
- id, name, issue, message

ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED:
======================

1. SYMPTOM CHECKER ALGORITHM:
   - Input: List of selected symptoms
   - Process: Map each symptom to associated conditions
   - Scoring: Count frequency of each condition
   - Output: Ranked list of possible conditions
   - Time Complexity: O(n × m) where n=symptoms, m=conditions per symptom

2. BMI CALCULATIONS:
   - BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)²
   - BMR (Male) = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
   - BMR (Female) = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161
   - TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor (1.2 to 1.9)
   - WHtR = waist(cm) / height(cm)

3. WELLNESS SCORE CALCULATION:
   - Mood weights: calm(85), happy(80), ok(65), sad(45), tired(40), angry(35)
   - Sleep adjustment: optimal 7-8 hours (+15), 6-9 hours (+5)
   - Stress penalty: (stress_level - 3) × 5
   - Final score: clamp(base_score, 0, 100)

AUTOMATION WORKFLOW:
===================
Patient fills Tally form → Make.com receives webhook → Checks Google Calendar availability → Creates calendar event → Sends confirmation email to patient → Sends notification to admin → Saves to database → COMPLETE
